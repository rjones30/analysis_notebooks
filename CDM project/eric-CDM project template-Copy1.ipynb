    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project explores the power of code-division multiplexing to encode a message within the correlations between the samples of an otherwise purely random and uncorrelated time series. The final goal is to discover the hidden messages that are found somewhere within a signal provided to you by a third party. The CDM scheme that was used to encode these messages is provided to you in the form of an object froom a python class called CDMcode. This object contains a set of 17 codes, any two of which may have been used to encode the secret messages. Each code is its own sequence of +1 and -1 values which appear to be random and uncorrelated within the code, but which is repeated on top of noise within the signal, and can be discovered by computing the covariance of the signal with each code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's generate a random signal, and represent it by a python array of integers containing values in the interval \\[-128, +128). To efficiently work with arrays in this project, we will use the numpy library that has lots of features for efficiently working with arrays. In numpy, integers in the range \\[-128, +128) are called bytes.\n"

    "Let's introduce a bunch of basic functionality for handling CDM signals by importing a custom python object class called CDMcode. Each time you construct a new object of this class, you get a complete set of codes for multiplexing messages from different channels into a combined signal at the transmitter, and for demultiplexing messages to different channels from the combined signal at the receiver. The process of multiplexing is called \"encoding\", and demultiplexing is called \"decoding\"."

This same power of 2 is what limits the total number of separate channels that can be multiplexed on a signal using this CDMcode object. This power is passed as an argument to the constructor. For example, CDMcode(5) would produce a CDMcode object that implements a cdm scheme with 6 (5 + 1) separate channels and a code length of 32. In this simple example, we set up such a scheme with 6 channels, and transmit a simple message over channel 2."
